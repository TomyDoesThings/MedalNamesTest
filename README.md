# MedalNamesTest
This is a Java program that I made that tests osu! medal hunters on the names of any osu! medals within the rhythm game osu!. You can choose which to practice based on all 8 categories that currently exist in the game. I have never really put this on my GitHub, until now (June 3, 2023 1:04 AM Eastern Time).
